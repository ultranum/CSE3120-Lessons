# CSE3120-Lessons Object Oriented Programming 1

## Definitions

__Object oriented programming (OOP)__ is the process of implementing Object-oriented Design in a functional program.

__Object Oriented Design (OOD)__ is the process of converting identifiable objects and their interactions into a template to construct any number of similar objects with similar properties and interactions.

A ___Class___ is a model of an object. Classes contain the _attributes_ and _behaviours_ which are present in all objects made from this model. A class can be thought of as a template or blueprint for making an object.
    - An example of a class is a _student_
    - An attribute is a property or characteristic that the object possesses. It is stored as a variable within the object.
        - the student class has an attribute, Student ID Number.
    - A behaviour is called a method and is something the object can do. It is represented as a function within the object.
        - the student class has a method, take notes.
        
An ___Object___ is a unique set of data and functions _instantiated_ from a class. An object accesses attributes and methods using _dot notation_, which identifies the object, then calls the method within it.
